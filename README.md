Simple level editor (WIP) for own game written in C# with use of Monogame game engine. Program allows to create game levels from separate textures,
that can be manipulated directly in editor (scale, color tint, rotation, z-order). My code is found in Core and UI folders.
All UI elements are made from scratch with procedural textures. Core has more logic regarding actual world objects.
